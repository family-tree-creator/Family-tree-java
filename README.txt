Our programs require an input file. The file "family1.txt" is provided as an example.

Java: 
	Click on .exe file. A window will pop up prompting the user to open a file. 
	Click the open button, and another window will pop up. Here it will allow you to select
	an input file. Navigate to and select the file "family1.txt" that has been included. 
	A window will pop up displaying the family tree. 
	Click on the center box to view information about an individual, 
	click again to return to the main family tree.
	Click on either the top (parent) boxes or lower (children) boxes to travel through a tree. 


	If exe does not work, compile as a normal Java program. Graphicsmain is the main class. 

Haskell: 
	(This line only for macs) Go to terminal and navigate to file directory where haskell files are. 
	Run ghci by inputting "ghci". Then load the input file by entering ":l input.hs".
	Input ":main" to run the program.
	A prompt "What file do you want to input: " will appear.
	Input "family1.txt". A person and who they are immediately related to will be listed.  
	To move to a different individual in the tree, input "moveTo " then the person's first and last name. 
	To end program, input "end". The program will respond with "goodbye", then close.
